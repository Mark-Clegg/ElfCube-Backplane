# Elf-Cube - Backplane
Simple retro computer based on the 1802 series of processors.

Backplane for the Elf-Cube, can host 5 separate I/O cards, and includes the circuitry for the master clock signal and power on reset. It also acts as the main power source for any attached cards, which can be supplied via 5.5mm jack, or USB. In addition, the D+/D- signals from the USB connector are also made available to slot 1 pins 15 and 34. If more than 5 slots are required, multiple backplanes can be slotted together, populating the additional cards with just the connectors. With a 4 MHz oscillator, the system clock is jumper selectable between 1,2 and 4 MHz.
